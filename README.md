# v3dBLAS

Simplest BLAS Operations Accelerated in Raspberry Pi GPU using V3DLib.

Initially, this was a part of [waffle](https://github.com/pasxn/waffle) and made stale due to some technical complexities.

v3dBLAS uses, [V3DLib](https://github.com/wimrijnders/V3DLib) to program the [Broadcom Videocore VI](https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/igpu-broadcom_videocore_vi) GPU in the [BCM2711](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf) SoC of the [Raspberrypi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) single board computer.

Use the shell scrips to clone, build and test the kernels.
